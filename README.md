# Secure Digital Provenance
This program is based on the Secure Data Provenance scheme detailed by Rangwala et al. (2014). However, it is a simplified version in which the provenance chain is linear and does not support a DAG structure. This project is intended to be integrated with the [DynaSwap project](https://github.com/iupui-soic/dynaswap).
